# Tree-Based Methods in R

## 8.R.R1

You are trying to reproduce the results of the R labs, so you run the following command in R:

> library(tree)

As a response, you see the following error message:

Error in library(tree) : there is no package called ‘tree’

What went wrong?

- You meant to use 'require(tree)'
- You meant to use 'library("tree")'
- **The tree package is not installed on your computer**
- Nothing is wrong, that error message could not be produced by R
