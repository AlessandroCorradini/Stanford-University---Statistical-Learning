## 8.Q1

The tree building algorithm given on pg 13 is described as a Greedy Algorithm. Which of the following is also an example of a Greedy Algorithm?:

- The Lasso
- Support Vector Machines
- The Bootstrap
- **Forward Stepwise Selection**

## 8.Q2

Examine the plot on pg 23. Assume that we wanted to select a model using the one-standard-error rule on the Cross-Validated error. What tree size would end up being selected?:

- 1
- **2**
- 3
- 10

## 8.Q3

Suppose I have two qualitative predictor variables, each with three levels, and a quantitative response. I am considering fitting either a tree or an additive model. For the additive model, I will use a piecewise-constant function for each variable, with a separate constant for each level. Which model is capable of fitting a richer class of functions:

- **Tree**
- Additive Model
- They are equivalent
