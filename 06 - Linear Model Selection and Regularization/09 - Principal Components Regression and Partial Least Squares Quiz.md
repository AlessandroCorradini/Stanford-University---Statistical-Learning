# Principal Components Regression and Partial Least Squares  

## 6.10.R1

You are working on a regression problem with many variables, so you decide to do Principal Components Analysis first and then fit the regression to the first 2 principal components. Which of the following would you expect to happen?:

- A subset of the features will be selected
- Model Bias will decrease relative to the full least squares model
- **Variance of fitted values will decrease relative to the full least squares model**
- Model interpretability will improve relative to the full least squares model
