## 6.Q.1

Suppose we estimate the regression coefficients in a linear regression model by minimizing

displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p\beta_jx_{ij}\right)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j^2

for a particular value of lambda. For each of the following, select the correct answer:

As we increase lambda from 0, the training RSS will:

**Steadlily Increase**

## 6.Q.2

As we increase lambda from 0, the test RSS will:

**Decrease initually, and then eventually start increasing in a U shape**

## 6.Q.3

As we increase lambda from 0, the variance will:

**Steadlily Decrease**

## 6.Q.4

As we increase lambda from 0, the (squared) bias will:

**Steadlily Increase**

## 6.Q.5

As we increase lambda from 0, the irreducible error will:

**Remain constant**
