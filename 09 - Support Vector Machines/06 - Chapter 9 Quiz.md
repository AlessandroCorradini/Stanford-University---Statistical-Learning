# Chapter 9 Quiz

## 9.Q.1

Suppose that after our computer works for an hour to fit an SVM on a large data set, we notice that x_4, the feature vector for the fourth example, was recorded incorrectly (say, one of the decimal points is obviously in the wrong place).

However, your co-worker notices that the pair (x_4,y_4) did not turn out to be a support point in the original fit. He says there is no need to re-fit the SVM on the corrected data set, because changing the value of a non-support point can't possibly change the fit.

Is your co-worker correct?

- Yes
- **No**
