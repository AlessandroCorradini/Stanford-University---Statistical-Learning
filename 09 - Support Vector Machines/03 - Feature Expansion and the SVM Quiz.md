## 9.3.R1

True or False: If no linear boundary can perfectly classify all the training data, this means we need to use a feature expansion.

- True
- **False**

## 9.3.R2

True or False: The computational effort required to solve a kernel support vector machine becomes greater and greater as the dimension of the basis increases.

- True
- **False**
