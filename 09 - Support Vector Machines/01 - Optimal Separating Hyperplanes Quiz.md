# Optimal Separating Hyperplanes Quiz

## 9.1.R1

If beta is not a unit vector but instead has length 2, then \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_j is

- **twice the signed Euclidean distance from the separating hyperplane \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j X_j = 0**
- half the signed Euclidean distance from X to the separating hyperplane*
- exactly the signed Euclidean distance from the separating hyperplane
