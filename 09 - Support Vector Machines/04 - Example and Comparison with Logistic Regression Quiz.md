# Example and Comparison with Logistic Regression Quiz

## 9.4.R1

Recall that we obtain the ROC curve by classifying test points based on whether \hat f(x) > t, and varying t.

How large is the AUC (area under the ROC curve) for a classifier based on a completely random function \hat f(x) (that is, one for which the orderings of the \hat f(x_i) are completely random)?
