# Principal Component Quiz

## 10.1.R1

You are analyzing a dataset where each observation is an age, height, length, and width of a particular turtle. You want to know if the data can be well described by fewer than four dimensions (maybe for plotting), so you decide to do Principal Component Analysis. Which of the following is most likely to be the loadings of the first Principal Component?

- (1, 1, 1, 1)
- **(.5, .5, .5, .5)**
- (.71, -.71, 0, 0)
- (1, -1, -1, -1)
