# Higher Order Principal Component Quiz

## 10.2.R1

Suppose we a data set where each data point represents a single student's scores on a math test, a physics test, a reading comprehension test, and a vocabulary test.

We find the first two principal components, which capture 90% of the variability in the data, and interpret their loadings. We conclude that the first principal component represents overall academic ability, and the second represents a contrast between quantitative ability and verbal ability.

What loadings would be consistent with that interpretation? Choose all that apply.

- (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (0.71, 0.71, 0, 0)
- (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (0, 0, -0.71, -0.71)
- **(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)**
- **(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5)**
- (0.71, 0.71, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0.71, 0.71)
- (0.71, 0, -0.71, 0) and (0, 0.71, 0, -0.71)
